###  Describe the technology used for the project and how others could use it in the future.

The technology used for this project was leaflet markers, buttons, and maps. In addition, microsoft forms and google sheets were used for collecting and storing data. Other people can use these tools to create their own website for social change. For example, the same method for data colloection can be used as well as the maps, which are open source, to help give a platform for those that are underrepresented to tell their stories.
