## Objectives 
Our project objectives are:
* Focusing on how Asian  elderly have been more fearful of going outside during the COVID-19 Pandemic than before the pandemic due to the rise in Asian hate crimes in California. 
* Ensuring that Asian Elderly and Women living in California are able to convey their stories and fears about the rise in Asian attacks without backlash from others. 
* Documentation of how fearful AAPI members were due to the rise in Asian hate crimes as well as a record of how hate crimes have affected each Asian elderly person and women differently. 

Who is being empowered?
* Asian Eldely and Women living in California will be empowered to be vulnerable about how they feel, such as their fear

Example user stories:
* "As a native San Diegan living in Southern California as an AAPI Women under the age of 59. I want to share my story, so I can spread awareness of how Asian American women are feeling due to the rise of hate crimes."
* "As an AAPI Woman who lives in Northern California (specifically San Jose), and is under the age of 59, I am filing out this survey as an outlet, so I can share my own experiences about how the rise in Asian American hate crimes have affected me emotionally without judgement from others."
* "As a member of the AAPI community who is 60 years old and lives in Southern California (specifically San Bernardino). I want to use this website to see how others of the same demographics and location as me are feeling about the rise in Asian American hate crimes, so I can feel a sense of community knowing that there are other people that share the same sentiments as me. If they do not share the same sentiments as me, I can see in another perspective and empathize with others since the rise in hate crimes has affected everyone differently."

###  Describe the technology used for the project and how others could use it in the future.

The technology used for this project was leaflet markers, buttons, and maps. In addition, microsoft forms and google sheets were used for collecting and storing data. Other people can use these tools to create their own website for social change. For example, the same method for data colloection can be used as well as the maps, which are open source, to help give a platform for those that are underrepresented to tell their stories.
