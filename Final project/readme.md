## Objectives 
Our project objectives are:
* Focusing on how Asian  elderly have been more fearful of going outside during the COVID-19 Pandemic than before the pandemic due to the rise in Asian hate crimes in California. 
* Ensuring that Asian Elderly and Women living in California are able to convey their stories and fears about the rise in Asian attacks without backlash from others. 
* Documentation of how fearful AAPI members were due to the rise in Asian hate crimes as well as a record of how hate crimes have affected each Asian elderly person and women differently. 

Who is being empowered?
* Asian Elderly and Women living in California will be empowered to share their stories and be vulnerable about their experiences during the rise in Asian hate crimes.  
* Asian Elderly and Women living in California (through sharing their stories) and readers will be empowered to spread awareness of how the spike in hate crimes are impacting this demographic.
* People who do not identify as Asian, elderly, or a women will be empowered to empathize with these individuals who are sharing their story and understand the different ways in which this spike in hate crimes have impacted this demographic. 
* This project will also empower other students and programmers to use open-source tools to construct a website that shines light on marginalized communities' voices to bring social change. 


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Leaflet maps
* Leaflet pop-ups
* Leaflet marker cluster plugins
* QGIS for mapping layers
* Turf.js
* Microsoft forms
* Google Sheets 
* Scrollama
* Leaflet legend 
* Bubble button (provided by w3schools)
* Google translation button 

## Repurposing Technology
* Other people can use these tools to create their own website for social change. For example, the same method for data colloection can be used as well as the maps, which are open source, to help give a platform for those that are underrepresented to tell their stories.
