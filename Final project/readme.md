## Objectives 
Our project objectives are:
* Focusing on how Asian  elderly have been more fearful of going outside during the COVID-19 Pandemic than before the pandemic due to the rise in Asian hate crimes in California. 
* Ensuring that Asian Elderly and Women living in California are able to convey their stories and fears about the rise in Asian attacks without backlash from others. 
* Documentation of how fearful AAPI members were due to the rise in Asian hate crimes as well as a record of how hate crimes have affected each Asian elderly person and women differently. 

Who is being empowered?
* Asian Elderly and Women living in California will be empowered to share their stories to spread awareness of how the spike in hate crimes are impacting this demographic.
* People who do not identify as Asian, elderly, or a women will be empowered to empathize with these individuals who are sharing their story and understand the different ways in which this spike in hate crimes have impacted this demographic. 
* This project will also empower other students and programmers to use open-source tools to construct a website that shines light on marginalized communities' voices to bring social change. 


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Leaflet maps
* Leaflet pop-ups
* Leaflet marker cluster plugins
* QGIS for mapping layers
* Turf.js
* Microsoft forms
* Google Sheets 
* Scrollama
* Leaflet legend 
* Bubble button (provided by w3schools)
* Google translation button 
* Swoopey
* Modal (from w3schools)
* Gauge 


## Repurposing Technology
People can repurpose all the tools used in this project to create their own website for social change. Since all aspects of the website are built with open source tools, these tools can be incorporated in almost any project. In particular, tools such as the leaflet map and markers can be used to create a website for more general cases of ongoing hate, such as areas with large numbers of Asian Americans, Hispanics, etc living in states such as Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. The website and tools used to build this website are not just Asian Americans. The website and tools used can be used for promoting other forms of social change such as encouraging voter turnout for elections at the state level and sharing stories about why people have/ have not voted. Other technologies used include microsoft forms and google sheets, which  are useful for collecting and storing different kinds of data in different contexts. The acessibility and versility of these tools enable people to use these tools in a variety of ways to build a platform for underrepresented communities to tell their stories and amplify their voices. 


## Features 
* Cards that contain respondents' stories (Ex: age, gender, location, and the reasons why they are/are not fearful in response to the rise in Asian hate crimes in California)
* Map that shows which parts of California that respondents are fearful
* Pop-ups that show the respondent's location (city and zipcode) and gender
* Fear-odometer visualize the amount of people (who filled out our survey) that are fearful/not fearful in NorCal and SoCal 
*  A legend that shows that age demographics of respondents on the map
* Translation button that enables people to use the language that they would like to use to interact with the website 
* An html page containing the survey to allow people to share their story
* Filtering system that enables people to see stories based on age group, location, and fearfulness 
* Scrollama that directs people on the map where that story was shared
